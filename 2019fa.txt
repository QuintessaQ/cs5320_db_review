select T.sid, T.bid from (select R.sid, R.bid, count(*) from Reserves R group by R.sid, R.bid ordered by count(*) DESC limit 1) as T

B1
the total memory cost is # pages in a block of the outer table + 2 = 12, so the size of a block in R is 10 pages. The total join cost = x + ceil(x/10) * 2x = x + x^2/5 = 30. So x = 10. 

B2
R consumes 50,000 bytes, or 50 pages. Assume the cost for each index access is x. Total cost = 50 + 5000 * x <= 10,000 . x = 1

B3
read twice, write once. 4(m+n)
